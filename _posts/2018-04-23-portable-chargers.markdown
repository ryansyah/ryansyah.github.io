So, I will be traveling to Red Hat Summit in less than a month. From past summits, I have learned that it is necessary to have a portable device charger, or always be on the lookout for an available AC outlet, which are always in short supply.

My charging needs:
- iPhone 6 Plus (64GB)
- iPad mini retina (gen2, 64GB)

In previous years I survived by using "freebie" battery chargers that were obtained on the summit expo floor, given away for free by Red Hat or other vendors as promotional swag (one of the more practical swag items, imho). Having owned a few of these chargers now, I can safely observe that they are promotional at best and YMMV in real world usage. Some work better than others. Some get **really, really** hot, some have a good initial charge out of the box while others will need to be fully charged before their first use. In practice, I found I was charging the phone all the time. Literally. All. The. Time, using 2-3 of the chargers over the course of a day and evening. This year I need to step up my game and obtain a better solution for my needs.

Getting an Uber with a dead phone sucks...

So, now we know the need. Let's getting the pre-purchase research:

- Familiarize yourself with portable device charging standards. I do not currently own a [Quick Charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quick_Charge) device, but I wouldn't mind what I buy now be future proofed for new gadgets down the road.

- Buy a bigger battery than you think you'll need, again for future proofing your purchase. Future devices will need more poweri and likely have higher capacities. Also, I'd like to potentially charge two devices at once if needed.

- Larger capacity batteries require longer charging time. Some battery packs will take 10+ hours using a 'Standard' wall wart USB charger...
  - Now I need to buy a quick charge charger now too?!?!?
  - Buy a battery pack that also takes advantage of current best charging options, again to future proof.
  - Consideration:  look at battery pack that includes a charger. Compare those costs against buying charger & battery pack separately.

After much research, debate and a good night's sleep, the winner is:

[**Anker PowerCore Speed 20000 PD**](http://a.co/51xYjP1)
 - Supports [**USB Power Delivery (PD) 3.0** standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C#USB_Power_Delivery_specification USB-C)
 - Can charge devices using PD, and be charged using PD
 - Comes with a 30W PD charger: [Anker USB Type-C with Power Delivery 30W USB Wall Charger, PowerPort Speed 1](http://a.co/42QTpA9)
 - Can be used to charge a macbook laptop
 - Popular solution for charging a Nintendo Switch (now I have a good excuse to get a Switch!)
 - Anker has always made solid chargers, I feel comfortable trying out their battery bank solution.
